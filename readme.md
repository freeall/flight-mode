# Flight Mode

Have you ever wanted to point to your screen and tell the flight attendant that "nono, it really is in flight mode"?

Well, here's your chance! This program for Mac OS / OSX will add Flight Mode for you. Turn off all your radio (wifi and bluetooth) devices in your computer, and lets you turn them right back on when you land.
